# The puzzle starts with the disks in a neat stack in ascending order of size on 
# one rod, the smallest at the top, thus making a conical shape.#

# The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, 
# obeying the following simple rules:
#   1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
#   2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and 
#     placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
#   3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
# With 3 disks, the puzzle can be solved in 7 moves. The minimal number of moves 
# required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n = number of disks.
